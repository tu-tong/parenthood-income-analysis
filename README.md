# Effect of parenthood on income

### Purposes
Gendered-based  income inequalities in parenthood is not a new area of study. However, to quantify its impact on different sub-parental groups and understand contributing factors that drive this gap remains less known. 

There are 2 goals for this project:
- Quantify parenthood impact on income
- Identify factors that drive this income gaps.


### Data & Variables description
Data is retrieved from IPUMS USA using the 2023 ACS sample. After data processing, 1,540,944 observations remain. 

##### Variables 
Features: age, hours worked per week, sex, education level, marital status, race, generation, occupational groups, age group when entering parenthood.
Control groups: parents vs non-parents
Target: total personal income

Defining parent age group (determine by age when having 1st kid):
Young: <25 (mothers), <30 (fathers)
Middle-aged: 25-39 (mothers), 30-45 (fathers)
Old: >40 (mothers), > 46 (fathers)


## Findings

In 2023, a significant income gap still exists between fathers and mothers. 

Gender continues to be a major factor influencing income differences, especially in the context of parenthood. While age is not as significant in determining income on its own, different age subgroups of parents show substantial variations in the impact of having children on their income.

When comparing more detailed sub-groups, the model also shows major differences in the impact on income.
Among different generations, the largest income disparity is observed among Gen Z parents.
Insignificant results for the effect of fatherhood and age of having first kid.

There seems to be major differences in occupations in healthcare and computer/engineering/science.
